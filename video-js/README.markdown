VideoJS - [HTML5 Video Player](http://videojs.com)
------------------------------------------------
View [VideoJS.com](http://videojs.com) for a demo and overview.

VideoJS is an HTML5 video player that uses the HTML5 video tag built into modern browsers, and javascript to add custom controls and functionality.

The base of VideoJS is Kroc Camen's [Video for Everybody](http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody), which is a video embed code that falls back to a Flash video player or download links for browsers and devices that don't support HTML5 video.

View demo.html for an example of how to use it.
